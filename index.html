I never wanted to hurt you — not even for a moment😔💔.
I don’t want to fight, or lose what we once had 🕊️.
All I’ve ever wanted is to see you smile 😊🌸 and 
achieve everything you dream of — with me or
without me✨💫.

If you ever need me, just call or text 📱💌.
I’ll always be here — quietly waiting on my side, 
expecting nothing in return 🌙🕯️.

If I ever made you feel pain, I’m truly sorry🙏💖.
The only thing I’ve ever had to give you is 
loyalty — pure and real 🧸💎.

And if somewhere in your heart,
 you still have a little feeling left for me💓…
Then just walk with me again 💞👣.

I don’t know what destiny has planned for us 🌌💫,
But I promise — I’ll always try to give my best💪🌹,
and love you in silence if I must 💖🌙.

Whether you talk to me or not,
you’ll always have a place in my heart❤️🫶.

   Sorry for hurting you  🌙
